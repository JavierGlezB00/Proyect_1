# SQL Project â€“ Clients & Products Database

This project was created as part of my learning process in **SQL and database management**.  
The main goal was to **design, build and query a relational database** from scratch using **MySQL**.

## Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to simulate a real business case where a company needs to store information about **clients** and their **purchased products**.  
The database allows performing analytical queries such as:

- Retrieving specific client and product information  
- Filtering data by categories or age ranges  
- Joining related tables  
- Calculating averages and counts by customer type  

Through this exercise, I practiced database design, normalization, and data manipulation using SQL.
