As first step I created the Data Base:

CREATE DATE BASE Proyect_1;

As second step I created the Tables:

First Table:

CREATE TABLE clients( 
id_clients int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
name varchar(50) NOT NULL, 
surname VARCHAR (100), 
email VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL, 
quota ENUM ("Premium", "Medium", "Low-Cheap"), 
UNIQUE (id_clients), 
PRIMARY KEY (id_clients) );

Second Table:

CREATE TABLE products (
id_products int NOT NULL,
product VARCHAR (50),
price DECIMAL (10,2),
id_clients int,
PRIMARY KEY (id_products),
UNIQUE (id_products),
foreign key (id_clients) REFERENCES clients (id_clients)
);

After this one colum was missing, I forget to add it at the beggining in my table clients, so after this I used the next query to add it correctly:

ALTER TABLE clients ADD column age int;

So after this, is the turn to add all the values, an example in the table clients is. The rest of the table I made it with chat gpt, to give me more examples:

INSERT INTO clients (
name, surname, age, email, quota) VALUES ( "Javier", "Gonzalez", "25", "Jgonzalez@gmail.com", "Premium");

Okey that is perfect, now lets go with the second table, that is called products:

INSERT INTO products (
product, price,id_clients) VALUES ("Headphones", 89.90, 1)

After try this, I have the mistake 1364, why? I didnt put the auto increment in my id_products. So lets go to fix it:

ALTER TABLE products MODIFY id_products ( INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT);

Now everything should be okey. Lets try it one more time:

INSERT INTO products (
product, price,id_clients) VALUES ("Headphones", 89.90, 1)

Everything is going good so I am going to use chat gpt to help me with more examples. I want to use a table of 10 products:

1 - Headphones
2 - Bagpack
3 - Computer
4 - Charger
5 - Tablet
6 - Car
7 - Bike
8 - TV
9 - Music Speaker
10 - TV control

Okey I start with the querys, the next one is super basic.
Show the name, surname, and quota of all clients whose quota is not “Low-Cheap”, ordered alphabetically by surname.

SELECT name, surname, quota
FROM clients
WHERE quota != "Low-Cheap"
ORDER BY surname ASC;
