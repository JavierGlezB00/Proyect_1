As first step I created the Data Base:

CREATE DATE BASE Proyect_1;

As second step I created the Tables:

First Table:

CREATE TABLE clients( 
id_clients int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
name varchar(50) NOT NULL, 
surname VARCHAR (100), 
email VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL, 
quota ENUM ("Premium", "Medium", "Low-Cheap"), 
UNIQUE (id_clients), 
PRIMARY KEY (id_clients) );

Second Table:

CREATE TABLE products (
id_products int NOT NULL,
product VARCHAR (50),
price DECIMAL (10,2),
id_clients int,
PRIMARY KEY (id_products),
UNIQUE (id_products),
foreign key (id_clients) REFERENCES clients (id_clients)
);
