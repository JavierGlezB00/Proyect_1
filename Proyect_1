As first step I created the Data Base:

CREATE DATE BASE Proyect_1;

As second step I created the Tables:

First Table:

CREATE TABLE clients( 
id_clients int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
name varchar(50) NOT NULL, 
surname VARCHAR (100), 
email VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL, 
quota ENUM ("Premium", "Medium", "Low-Cheap"), 
UNIQUE (id_clients), 
PRIMARY KEY (id_clients) );

Second Table:

CREATE TABLE products (
id_products int NOT NULL,
product VARCHAR (50),
price DECIMAL (10,2),
id_clients int,
PRIMARY KEY (id_products),
UNIQUE (id_products),
foreign key (id_clients) REFERENCES clients (id_clients)
);

After this one colum was missing, I forget to add it at the beggining in my table clients, so after this I used the next query to add it correctly:

ALTER TABLE clients ADD column age int;

So after this, is the turn to add all the values, an example in the table clients is:

INSERT INTO clients (
name, surname, age, email, quota) VALUES ( "Javier", "Gonzalez", "25", "Jgonzalez@gmail.com", "Premium");
