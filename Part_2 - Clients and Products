Hello everyone!

Today I wanted to challenge myself a bit more with some SQL exercises that are slightly more advanced.
To do that, I asked ChatGPT to give me a couple of examples to practice with.

Exercise 1
Show the products whose price is higher than the average price of all products.

SELECT product, price
FROM products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);


Exercise 2
(Being honest, this one was really hard for me to figure out — so far, the most difficult query I’ve done!)

Show how many clients there are by quota type and by age range:

- Under 25 years old
- Between 25 and 40 years old
- Over 40 years old

SELECT quota,
COUNT(*) AS total_clients,
CASE
    WHEN age < 25 THEN 'Under 25 years old'
    WHEN age > 25 AND age < 40 THEN 'Between 25 and 40 years old'
    WHEN age > 40 THEN 'Over 40 years old'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
END AS age_client
FROM clients
GROUP BY quota, age_client;
